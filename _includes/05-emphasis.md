## About me

_|ADD MORE ABOUT ME|_ 

I am an _analytical_ and _systematic thinker_, with a wide array of _organisational_ and _interpersonal skills_. I have worked in a wide range of fields which gives me a _broad perspective_ on different approaches and different ways of working. I am bringing this experience with me as I embark my journey to become a **programmer** and **games designer**. I am learning **C#** with **Unity** and **Visual Studio** to create projects that help expand my understanding of programming and design.
